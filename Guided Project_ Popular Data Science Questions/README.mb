In this scenario, you're working for a company that creates data science content, be it books, online articles, videos or interactive text-based platforms like Dataquest.

You're tasked with figuring out what is best content to write about. 

Since you're passionate about helping people learn, you decide to scower the internet in search for the answer to the question "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?" (as opposed to determining the most profitable content, for instance).

Our goal in this project is to use [Data Science Stack Exchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/) to determine what content should a data science education company create, based on interest by subject.
