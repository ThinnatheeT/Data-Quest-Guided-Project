In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest ([Fandango](https://www.fandango.com) is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) â€” a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.

In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.
